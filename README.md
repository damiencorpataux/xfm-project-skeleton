It is suitable for a simple web-site containing a bunch of dynamic, database-related pages/forms.


How to setup mysql database
===========================

**First:**
- either create a database user according **default.ini** db configuration
- or change **default.ini** db configured user and password to suit
  the existing database user you want to use

**Then:**
```bash
cd /var/www/app/scripts/deploy
php database.php
```

**Finally:**
- Point your browser to your application URL (eg. http://localhost/app/public if you followed the wiki chapter [Deploying basic-project stub](https://github.com/damiencorpataux/xfm-project-skeleton/wiki)).


Notes
=====

Look at the **sql/** directory, containing the sql files to execute in order to create the database.
Filenames are prefixed with a number that defines execution order.
